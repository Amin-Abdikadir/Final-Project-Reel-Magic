# Reel Magic
by ReelStack

## Join the reel revolution

<h3>Overview</h3>
Reel Magic is a community-driven platform where users control the reviews, allowing them to discover films that suit their tastes through honest, peer-based opinions. By making the review process transparent and focusing on user interaction, we aim to improve the film review experience, which is often dominated by professional critics.

<h3>Our mission</h3> 
Empower everyday users to take control of the film review process. We built a mobile-first platform, acknowledging that 91% of internet traffic is on smartphones. Our goal is to reduce browsing time and deliver personalized, trustworthy movie recommendations.
